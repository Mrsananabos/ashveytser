'Tis now near night.

That's a certain text.
Farewell, dear father!
Enter JULIET and Nurse
Laying down her dagger
Go, you cot-quean, go,
can lick their fingers.
Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
Spare not for the cost.
Make haste, make haste.
Tush, I will stir about,
fingers goes not with me.
Of disobedient opposition
Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
For this night's watching.
How canst thou try them so?
In this so sudden business.
SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.

Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
May be put from her by society:
For I have need of many orisons
Nurse! What should she do here?
A jealous hood, a jealous hood!
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
I wake before the time that Romeo
My father Capulet will have it so;
Or bid me go into a new-made grave
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.
To County Paris, to prepare him up
SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.
Shall be the label to another deed,
We shall be short in our provision:
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
Uneven is the course, I like it not.
To stop the inundation of her tears;
Do not deny to him that you love me.
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
Our whole city is much bound to him.
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
If I do so, it will be of more price,
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
God shield I should disturb devotion!
Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
I will confess to you that I love him.
If, rather than to marry County Paris,
Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
Then, as the manner of our country is,
And hither shall he come: and he and I
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
To help me sort such needful ornaments
Because he married me before to Romeo?
Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
Which craves as desperate an execution.
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
So many guests invite as here are writ.
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
What if it be a poison, which the friar
Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
Environed with all these hideous fears?
Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.
Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
You say you do not know the lady's mind:
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
To answer that, I should confess to you.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
So please you, let me now be left alone,
That almost freezes up the heat of life:
I'll call them back again to comfort me:
What if this mixture do not work at all?
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,--
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
Which the commission of thy years and art
From off the battlements of yonder tower;
To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
Each part, deprived of supple government,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
Send for the county; go tell him of this:
Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
For so he said he would: I hear him near.
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
It strains me past the compass of my wits:
If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
Come you to make confession to this father?
On Thursday next be married to this county.
If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
And with this knife I'll help it presently.
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
And madly play with my forefather's joints?
She falls upon her bed, within the curtains
That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
The county will be here with music straight,
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
When presently through all thy veins shall run
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
That copest with death himself to scape from it:
Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
And this shall free thee from this present shame;
Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
[Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.
Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen
Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
